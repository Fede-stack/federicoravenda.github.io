I hold a degree in Statistics from Universit√† Milano-Bicocca and am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Universit√† della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Lugano, Switzerland. My research primarily, but not only, focuses on the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Digital Health, leveraging advanced methods such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), dense retrieval, deep probabilistic modeling, and large language models (LLMs).

During my PhD, I have worked on classification systems for the automatic screening of social media users to identify behavioral disorders based on their digital footprints. In the conversational AI domain, I have explored empathetic conversational approaches as well as methods for tasks like conversational search, including clarification need prediction. Beyond NLP, my work extends to applying machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for time series analysis.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Research Interests

**Behavioral Health Monitoring**: Tailoring AI systems grounded in psychological principles  for the automatic screening of social media users, identifying behavioral disorders through digital footprints.

**Interpretability in NLP**: Developing interpretable models to enhance understanding in clinical NLP applications.

**Conversational AI**:  Research on retrieval-augmented generation techniques and conversational systems, exploring methods to create more context-aware and naturally flowing users interactions.
